# SanitizedScripts
A selection of old Shell Scripts that I've written.
 - Sanitized of all Employer Specific Information as much as possible.  (Hostnames, EMails, etc.)

Some of these scripts are rather old and not necessarily how I would write them now.

(I included older scripts to show the evolution of my script writing or because of the impact some of them had.)

All of these scripts are being shared "as is."

 - Use at your own Risk.

Or better yet, just use them as inspiration for how problems could be solved.  =)

I have no intention of updating these scripts because I no longer have access to the environments I wrote them in to validate the functionality of any changes.
